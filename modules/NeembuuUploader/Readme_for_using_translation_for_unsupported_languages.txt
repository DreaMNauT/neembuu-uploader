If you don't use translations, 
or the translation which you have selected is working properly
in Neembuu and characters are showing correctly,
ignore this file.

This file is for Telgu,Tamil,Gujrati and other languages, 
whose support is not present by default.

Tamil for example not one of the officially supported locale by Java. 
But there is a workaround for this.

If you wish to use Neembuu Uploader in Tamil, kindly copy the included 'LATHA.TTF' font to
"<JRE_INSTALL_DIR>/jre/lib/fonts/fallback"

For Excelsior based exe version
<Location where neembuu uploader is installed>\rt\lib\fonts\fallback\

For other languages, you need to find the appropriate font and do the same.
